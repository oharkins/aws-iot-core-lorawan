# If you want to implement additional binary decoders, please follow these steps:
# Step 1: Choose a name for a binary decoder, for example "mylorawandevice".
# Step 2: Implement binary decoder in a file "mylorawandevice.py". This file must contain "dict_from_payload(input:str)"
# function, which takes a binary payload as an input and returns a dict with the decoded results.
# Step 3: Add "import mylorawandevice.py" below
# Step 4: Add "mylorawandevice" as a value to VALID_PAYLOAD_DECODER_NAMES

    """ Transforms a binary payload by invoking "decode_{event.type}" function
        Parameters 
        ----------
        WirelessDeviceId : str
            Device Id
        WirelessMetadata : json
            Metadata
        PayloadData : str
            Base64 encoded input payload
        PayloadDecoderName : string
            The value of this attribute defines the name of a Python module which will be used to perform binary decoding. If value of "type" is for example "sample_device", then this function will perform an invocation of "sample_device.dict_from_payload" function. For this approach to work, you  have to import the necessary modules, e.g. by performing a "import sample_device01" command in the beginning of this file.

        Returns
        -------
        This function returns a JSON object with the following keys:

        - status: 200 or 500
        - transformed_payload: result of calling "decode_{event.type}"      (only if status == 200)
        - error_type                                                        (only if status == 500)
        - error_message                                                     (only if status == 500)
        - stackTrace                                                        (only if status == 500)
